    <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Above is the West room, before ripping out the old display walls and after cleaning, patching, texturing and a new coat of paint.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><canvas border="0" width="300" height="225"></canvas></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Above, Becky Giese doing the wall painting.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><canvas border="0" width="300" height="225"></canvas></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Above, a sample of the new ceiling tile.&nbsp; Next week for sure we will drop these in.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><canvas id="159" border="0" width="300" height="225"></canvas><canvas id="161" border="0" width="300" height="225"></canvas></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Above is the original view of the East (Oval) room.&nbsp; Notice no windows are visible?&nbsp; You can not see in the pictures the extent of water damage, but it was there requiring all of this material to come out.</font></p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"><canvas border="0" width="300" height="224"></canvas></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Daryl doing some end of day clean up.&nbsp; The Dorsey's, Rob Henderson, Troy and Jeff helped today in addition to more people last week.&nbsp;&nbsp; I like the looks of the floor to the right of the picture.&nbsp; We are getting down to almost what the Eagles Club is, we will be sanding it also.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><canvas border="0" width="300" height="225"></canvas></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Another view of the cleaned area.&nbsp; More than 2/3's left, hurry to sign up to help.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Also coming this next week, new bathroom's start being constructed.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#FF0000" size="6">Previous posts-</font></p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial Black" color="#FFFFFF">Well, here are a few pictures to help show our direction.&nbsp; Oshkosh R/C has procured a building that will be specifically used for racing in 2003.&nbsp; At present, we will continue to run at Studio Hall (the former Eagles Club) but will hopefully run the last season in the new digs.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial Black" color="#FFFFFF">This represents a major investment in the R/C program in the Oshkosh area.&nbsp; There is no way this alone can produce a payback.&nbsp; Possibly long term, it may pay its own heat bill.&nbsp; Why do this?&nbsp; To support you our racers and to make our program growth continue.&nbsp; We will be trying to run on more days (spread out the programs so they don't go so late at night).&nbsp; We wish to allow more people to enjoy the sport and we also wish to open some nights just for practice times.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial Black" color="#FFFFFF">With 5 other indoor tracks within 100 miles, why have we done this?&nbsp; Again, our numbers are staggering in the R/C world.&nbsp; What we call a low attendance day is a big event for others.&nbsp; This comes around because we (the people who run the program) have fun doing this.&nbsp; It is not for money, its for fun, smiles, achievement and getting together with friends.&nbsp; We hope you join us in making this a positive place for not only the Fox Valley, but for the state.&nbsp; You see, we will be going after major races also to supplement our local groups and that will help cover the investment.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial Black" color="#FFFFFF">Now, we need help.&nbsp; The pictures below are after one weekend of work by Bob Giese and crew.&nbsp; This was a former furniture store with plenty of partitions and fake inner walls.&nbsp; It also needs serious upgrades of insulation, lighting and facilities.&nbsp; We have a very tight budget, volunteers are needed for another couple of weekends (or nights) to whip this into shape.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial Black" color="#FFFFFF">After clean up, we wish to stud the walls and insulate (along with freshening the electrical drops), replace the drop ceiling with new energy efficient lighting and do something with the windows.&nbsp; If you know a supplier who would be interested in donating (for reduced costs or advertising exchange) let me know.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Now, on to the quick tour-</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">The actual address is 811 Oregon Street.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><canvas border="0" width="408" height="308"></canvas></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">The view from across the street.&nbsp; Our building is the one with the blue awning on the front (yes, all 65+ feet wide.&nbsp; It is two full floors high with the front room 80 feet long.&nbsp; There is parking on Oregon, 8th street, 9th street and in various lots that are closer than we have to deal with now.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><canvas border="0" width="406" height="307"></canvas></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">The main lobby area where the existing track carpet will go to finish the season.&nbsp; Yes, there remains plenty of pit space and room for soda/snack machines and there is a pizza place next door.&nbsp; The run line of the track will not change, except there will be two pipes in the infield.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><canvas border="0" width="415" height="314"></canvas></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">This is the 9th street entrance (under the red awning).&nbsp; The dumpsters are not ours and will be moved.&nbsp; This is just around the corner of 9th and Oregon.&nbsp; This lot will hold 10-15 cars.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><canvas border="0" width="417" height="314"></canvas></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">The back room, upstairs (65' x 60', that is about the size of the Eagles Club floor).&nbsp; This is projected for road racing and slot car tracks by the fall of 2003.&nbsp; Sorry the picture turned out dark, it was late in the afternoon.&nbsp; We need someone with a concrete surface cutter to level some areas, anyone have one??</font></p>
    <p align="left"><canvas border="0" width="371" height="281"></canvas><canvas border="0" width="370" height="281"></canvas></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">The front room of the upstairs.&nbsp; Sixty five foot wide by eighty foot long.&nbsp; It needs the carpets to be torn up, under layment put down and the ceiling replaced.&nbsp; It may look a little rough now (after two days of tear out by Bob Geise and his crew, this looks good to me) but it will come around.&nbsp; The windows are a welcome treat but need storms (anyone??).</font></p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">So, we really need contractors in both electrical and plumbing (lets just say we need to freshen the facilities).&nbsp; We need discounts on (or donations of) labor, wood, insulation, ceiling materials light fixtures, sound systems, video systems, tile and carpet (not for the track, but for the other areas).&nbsp; Basically, let me know what may be out there to help us bring you the ultimate race facility.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Thanks all for a great future.</font></p>
